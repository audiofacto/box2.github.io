 Before Donating , you must see that why we need DONATION and why you should donate us. Because, you sholud know reasons-
 <br>
             <strong style="font-size: 25px">SOME REASONS-</strong>
<i><ul>So, let's start. We are giving free audiobooks in our website & providing many other features to you.By which you can feel motivated & live your life with a great potential and get out of your comfort zone  and from imaginary world. And we also give you the courage & direction to live life and achive goals. But as you know that <tt>"Great things take time." </tt> And if you think we are doing great you can<strong> DONATE US!! </strong> There is no premium in this  website. Because I do not like premiums. So, we did not add this feature.  And it is also annoying for our users.</ul>


<strong><ul style="font-size: 25px">VALUE-</ul></strong>
We know that this website can be helpful to you and you give value to our webpage. If there is no value our team will collapse, there would be no motivation to start or do work & this is a crack.


<strong><ul style="font-size: 25px">CONCLUSION-</ul></strong>
So, after this we just want to say, that if you  want to donate then you can donate or if not, there is no problem.There may be some reason (may be you are a student or a person who can't afford this). So, there is no pressure on you. But to be honest you sholud <strong>DONATE US!! which can make our lives more easier and we can contribute this to our(or your) website. So, just <i>DONATE</i> </strong>
